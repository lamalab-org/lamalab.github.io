# we believe science is strongest when it includes diverse voices and perspectives

yet systemic barriers prevent many talented individuals from pursuing scientific careers—not due to lack of ability, but because of inequitable access to opportunities, guidance, and support networks.

as members of lamalab, we recognize the privilege and support that have shaped our own paths. the lamalab mentoring program is our commitment to opening doors for the next generation of scientists.

## we’re just getting started

this is the first cohort of our mentoring program, and we're building it together. we have a structure in mind, but we're open to feedback and eager to learn as we go. our goal is not just to mentor individuals, but to grow a supportive community that evolves based on what mentees actually need. your input will help shape this program for future cohorts.

### what you'll gain

- career guidance: navigate academic and industry paths in science
- practical support: advice on applications, career planning, and major decisions
- skill development: research skills, scientific communication, networking, and more
- community: connection with mentors and fellow mentees who support each other
- resources: access to some of lamalab's internal tools and materials
- accountability: regular check-ins to help you stay on track with your goals
- voice in shaping the program: your feedback will help us build something truly useful

### program structure

we're starting with this framework, but we'll adapt based on what works:

- duration: 1 year of support tailored to your educational stage (with possibility of extension)
- group sessions: quarterly virtual meetings with all mentees, lamalab members/alumni, and kevin
- peer mentorship: you'll be paired with fellow mentees for mutual support between sessions
- one‑on‑one mentorship: flexible individual sessions with lamalab members based on your needs
- regular check‑ins: structured goal‑setting and progress conversations to keep you moving forward
- time commitment: quarterly group meetings plus occasional 1‑on‑1 sessions and peer connections

### who should apply

we welcome students at any stage—high school, bachelor's, or master's level—from anywhere in the world.

we are especially committed to supporting:

- women and gender minorities in science
- students from regions with limited access to scientific resources
- first‑generation students and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
- anyone who faces barriers that might otherwise prevent them from pursuing a scientific career

you don't need to be the "perfect" student—we're looking for curiosity, motivation, and potential, not flawless grades or prestigious credentials.

not sure if this is for you? email us at mentoring@lamalab.org to chat informally. we're happy to answer questions and help you decide if this program is a good fit.

### how to apply

email mentoring@lamalab.org with:

- a brief statement (1 paragraph) about why you're interested and what you hope to gain
- information about your background and experiences—this can be a traditional cv, a brief narrative, or whatever format works best for you

we're excited to build this community with you and learn together.
