we apply data-driven techniques to discover materials that work in the real world. through novel machine learning approaches and close collaboration with experimental partners, we bridge the gap between computational predictions and practical applications.

our group is funded by the carl-zeiss foundation as the "czs research group polymers in energy applications". we are part of the [friedrich-schiller-university jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/) and the [helmholz institute for polymers in energy applications jena](https://www.hipole-jena.de/).

## research
we develop actionable, data-driven solutions for real-world materials design challenges across multiple scales. our machine learning models serve as navigation systems for the chemical space, created in partnership with experimental collaborators.

transparency and practicality guide our work - all code and data are shared under permissive licenses in reusable forms. [we believe computational work without open code is mere advertisement](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf).

### leveraging tacit knowledge
while abundant chemical data exists in publications, most remains unutilized. laboratory experiments often proceed without optimal integration of existing scientific knowledge - sometimes even disconnected from previous work within the same group.

machine learning techniques, especially large language models, help us unlock and access this valuable information. they capture subtle, tacit aspects of chemistry that conventional machine learning approaches - limited to "idealized" structural representations - cannot grasp.
