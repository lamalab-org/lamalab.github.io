if you want to join the team, please contact us [via this form](https://forms.fillout.com/t/eoGA7AhnAKus) - we are always happy to speak to potential new team members at all levels.
each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to diversify our team further.

we value doing impactful work. [but we do not believe in rushing things, but instead aim for a sustainable pace.](https://kjablonka.com/blog/posts/take_it_easy/)

for students pursuing a masters degree, we compiled a list of potential topics.

# Project Ideas

| Project | Lead/Supervisor | Description |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Mechanism parsing & LIFT training | Martiño Ríos-García | Parse mechanism explanations from books/webpages for common reactions, then train using LIFT to potentially improve performance of models like Flower |
| Organic data extraction | Martiño Ríos-García | Multiple directions possible: extract all protocols from OrgSyn (high-value data), or other organic chemistry extraction tasks |
| Flexible polymer data extraction | Mara Schilling-Wilhelmi | Focus on flexible extraction pipelines rather than extraction quality improvement, leveraging strong capabilities of recent models (e.g., Gemini) |
| ChemPile subset & model training | Adrian Mirza | Create or contribute to building a curated subset of ChemPile and train a model on it |
| IUPAC-SMILES bootstrapping | Adrian Mirza | Bootstrapping project for IUPAC-SMILES conversion (and potentially NMR bootstrapping); Kevin to supervise and provide initial code/data |
