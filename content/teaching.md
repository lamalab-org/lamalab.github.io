we care about disseminating knowledge.

we have developed tutorials: 

- [hands-on tutorial building llms and llm-based agents](https://github.com/lamalab-org/llm-tutorial)
- [tutorial on building rag (in german)](https://lamalab-org.github.io/rag-tutorial/)
- [tutorial on basics of ml for materials science](https://github.com/kjappelbaum/ml_molsim)

as well as online books: 

- [on data extraction](https://matextract.pub)
- [on general purpose models](https://gpmbook.lamalab.org)

and interactive apps: 

- [for teaching ir spectroscopy](https://ir.cheminfo.org)

we have also written about teaching and mentorship: 

- [with other cas future leaders](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.3c00500)
- [and about teaching digital chemistry](https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(24)00536-9)

we also have written a [tiny textbook (in german)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-658-17021-9) about thermodynamics.


at fsu jena, we currently offer a seminar (with sociology) on "critical aspects of ai" and a lecture on "advanced methods in digital chemistry". we also run the seminar "current topics in cheminformatics" in collaboration with the steinbeck group (who leads the organization). some notes about it can be found [here](https://lamalab-org.github.io/toolminutes/).

in collaboration with christoph steinbeck we also work on [bringing digital tools to lab courses](https://www.uni-jena.de/en/348062/innovative-ideas-for-university-teaching).
