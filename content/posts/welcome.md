Welcome to the official blog of the Lab for AI in Materials Science!

## About This Blog

This is where we'll share:

- Updates on our latest research
- Insights into AI applications in materials science
- Tutorials and guides for our tools and datasets
- Thoughts on the future of computational materials design

## Our Mission

We are a research group trying to teach computers how to design materials that work in the real world. Through machine learning, quantum chemistry, and experimental validation, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible in materials discovery.

Stay tuned for more exciting content!
