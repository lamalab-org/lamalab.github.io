last month, we were awarded as one of the ten best research environment by [Die Jungen Akademie](https://www.diejungeakademie.de/en/projekte/best-research-environment-award/shortlist-2024). our application was one of 25 selected from 270 applicants to attend the selection event in Berlin. randomly, we were selected as a winner! here we share the english version of the essay component of our application (there is also a german version, translated by our native german speaking colleague).

# application

building an inclusive, supportive research space that balances creativity and productivity is no easy task, yet, **&lt;Lama Lab&gt;** has accomplished this feat. only through a non-hierarchical structure that emphasizes collaboration over competition is this balance achieved.

unlike other traditional research groups, the structure of our group meetings is tailored to our unique needs. we start with one person leading the discussion, either with an in-depth research update or sharing a research paper. this conversation is followed by each group member sharing one success of the week, one challenge, and an interesting visual. this format creates space to celebrate each other’s accomplishments while also recognizing that challenges pave the way to success.

the organizational and communication structures in our group ensure that the experience of doing research is seamless and clear. a great example is our online workspace, Notion. the landing page itself is jam-packed with resources including group values, how our research fits into the broader science landscape, mental health resources, and much more. we also have specific administrative roles (social media, lab calendar, and social event organizer) defined on Notion and assigned to create balance within the group, while still leaving room for collaboration.

our main communication tool is Zulip, a free, open-source way to chat with each
other. transparency is an emphasis in our group and Zulip allows everyone to engage in real-time on project updates, ask questions, and share interesting papers. we also have many avenues for providing feedback anonymously like Teamspective–cumulative team survey.

learning is a priority in our group. to that end, we have created reading groups on topics relevant to our research (polymers, deep learning, etc.). we gather together in lively discussion about these topics, which creates a space for learning new material in a structured and supportive environment.

within our larger institution, collaboration with other research groups comes naturally through weekly lunches, shared journal clubs, and department-wide seminars. the opportunity to attend conferences, hackathons, and workshops is given to everyone in our group regardless of their academic position (bachelors’, masters, or phd). these events nurture global interconnectedness and have led to collaborations with companies like Intel and Stability AI and research groups in other countries.

career advancement and preparation is as much a focus in our group as the research we do. we utilize the my *IDP Science Careers Tool* to input our skills, values, and future career plans for our group leader to review and find opportunities that align with our goals. these individual development plans are uniquely designed for each student's needs.

as our group continues to grow, our group leader has directly involved all current students in the hiring process to build a research environment that is in line with our existing values.
