## we will name it after some of the research papers

for the new paper of the month everyone should submit one or more papers. the paper should ideally be published in the last month or so, but it’s fine if it’s a bit older. each of the papers should be followed by a short description, one or two paragraphs. the description should contain some of the following: why did you pick this paper? what do you like/what do you not like? what is interesting in there for you? make the descriptions personal and give your opinions rather than just describing the paper. i will collect all of the responses into one blog post and send it to you before it gets released for the final check. 

i will prepare a proper template once we have the first post out, since i am still unsure how the post would exactly look like.

Deadline: 29th of Jan
